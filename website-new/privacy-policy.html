                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p>Last updated: November 1, 2025</p>
            </div>
            <div class="legal-content">
                <p>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") constitutes a legally binding agreement between you ("User," "you," or "your") and AgileEmails ("Company," "we," "us," or "our") governing your access to and use of the AgileEmails browser extension ("Extension" or "Service"), including any related functionality, code, or derivative works thereof. By installing, enabling, or otherwise using the Extension, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms herein. If you do not agree with this Policy in its entirety, you must immediately cease use of the Extension and uninstall it from your device.</p>

                <h2>1. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h2>
                <p>The Company may, in accordance with the functionality of the Extension and applicable legal frameworks, collect, process, or temporarily access certain limited categories of data for operational purposes. Such data may include, but is not limited to, basic profile identifiers (e.g., first and last name), occupational categories, institutional domains, or generalized metadata associated with email correspondence (e.g., sender domain, subject line, timestamp). The Extension does not engage in the collection, storage, transmission, or remote analysis of personal email content, attachments, or message bodies. All such processing activities occur locally within the confines of the browser's secure execution environment and are restricted to Chrome's native extension storage mechanisms.</p>

                <h2>2. NATURE AND PURPOSE OF PROCESSING</h2>
                <p>All information collected or processed is undertaken solely to enable the Extension's intended functions, which include the intelligent organization, prioritization, and management of incoming electronic mail through ranking, categorization, or filtering mechanisms. The Company does not utilize said data for profiling, behavioral advertising, cross-site tracking, or commercial resale. The Extension's local operations may analyze historical interaction metadata exclusively for the purpose of improving queue management or sorting algorithms, and any outputs remain confined to the user's browser instance.</p>

                <h2>3. LEGAL BASIS AND CONSENT</h2>
                <p>By the act of installation or continued operation, you provide express consent for the processing of locally stored metadata in accordance with this Policy. Should applicable data protection legislation (including, but not limited to, the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") or the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA")) apply to you, such consent shall be construed as a freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of your agreement to said processing. You may withdraw this consent at any time by removing the Extension from your browser, after which no further data will be processed or retained.</p>

                <h2>4. STORAGE, RETENTION, AND SECURITY</h2>
                <p>All processed information is maintained solely within the confines of your device's storage subsystem utilizing Chrome's extension APIs (e.g., chrome.storage.local). No data is transmitted, stored, or synchronized to any remote database, cloud service, or third-party server. The Company has implemented reasonable technical and organizational safeguards consistent with industry standards to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company expressly disclaims liability for any compromise of data resulting from factors beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to system vulnerabilities, browser exploits, or end-user negligence.</p>

                <h2>5. DISCLOSURE TO THIRD PARTIES</h2>
                <p>The Company does not disclose, sell, lease, license, or otherwise transfer user data to third parties for monetary or non-monetary consideration. Any hypothetical disclosure, were it to occur, would be limited to instances mandated by applicable law, regulation, or legal process, and only to the extent strictly necessary to comply therewith. The Company disclaims any responsibility for the privacy practices, terms, or content of such third-party sites.</p>

                <h2>6. DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS</h2>
                <p>Subject to jurisdictional applicability, you may possess certain statutory rights regarding access, rectification, erasure, portability, or restriction of processing of your data. Because the Extension operates locally and does not transmit information externally, such requests are inherently fulfilled by uninstalling the Extension and thereby eradicating all locally stored data. The Company does not maintain separate user records or copies thereof and, consequently, cannot retrieve, alter, or export user-specific data.</p>

                <h2>7. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h2>
                <p>The Extension is neither directed to, nor intended for use by, individuals under eighteen (18) years of age. The Company does not knowingly collect personal information from minors. Any inadvertent installation or use by such individuals must be terminated immediately, and the Extension uninstalled.</p>

                <h2>8. INTERNATIONAL USE AND DATA TRANSFERS</h2>
                <p>As the Extension does not transmit data externally, no cross-border data transfer occurs. Should future versions introduce remote processing functionality, this Policy shall be amended accordingly to ensure compliance with international data transfer standards including, without limitation, the EU Standard Contractual Clauses and the UK International Data Transfer Addendum.</p>

                <h2>9. POLICY MODIFICATION</h2>
                <p>The Company reserves the unilateral right to revise, modify, or otherwise amend this Policy at its sole discretion and at any time without prior notice, to reflect changes in functionality, applicable law, or Company practice. The latest version shall be deemed authoritative and supersede all previous iterations. Continued use of the Extension following such modification shall constitute your acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

                <h2>10. CONTACT INFORMATION</h2>
                <p>For inquiries, clarifications, or the exercise of statutory rights (to the extent applicable), you may contact the Company at the following address:</p>

                <h2>11. MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
                <p>This Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of New York State, without regard to conflict of law principles. If any provision of this Policy is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Headings herein are for convenience only and shall not affect interpretation.</p>
